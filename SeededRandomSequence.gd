#This Class module manages an instanced Random Sequence
#It tracks it's own sequence of results so you can refer back to them at any point
#It's seed persists, so you don't have to worry about the regular RNG messing it up
#Place this in your module, for example res://lib/SeededRandomSequence.gd


#Initial and current state

#The results, in sequence
